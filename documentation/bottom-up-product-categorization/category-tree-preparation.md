## Category Tree Preparation

### Overview

The category tree preparation is a crucial step in setting up the bottom-up product categorization system. This process involves analyzing, cleaning, and transforming the raw category tree data into a format that's optimized for our categorization tasks. We use Jupyter notebooks to perform this preparation, allowing for interactive data exploration and transformation.

### The Process

Our category tree preparation involves several key steps, each implemented in a separate notebook for clarity and modularity.

#### 1. Category Tree Prep (Notebook 1)

This notebook focuses on cleaning and structuring the raw category tree data. Key operations include:

- Loading the raw category tree data (e.g., from the GS1 GPC standard)
- Cleaning category names and descriptions
- Extracting leaf categories
- Building the full path for each category
- Saving the processed category tree in a structured JSON format

The output of this notebook is a clean, well-structured representation of the category tree that serves as the foundation for subsequent steps.

#### 2. Metaclasses Generation (Notebook 2)

This notebook is responsible for generating the metaclasses that are crucial for our initial categorization step. The process includes:

- Loading the cleaned category tree from Notebook 1
- Extracting all unique words from category names
- Cleaning and preprocessing these words (e.g., lowercasing, removing stop words, singularizing)
- Generating a list of metaclasses
- Creating mappings between metaclasses and categories

This notebook also handles the preparation of word embeddings:

- Downloading pre-trained word embeddings (e.g., from FastText)
- Filtering the embeddings to include only words present in our category tree
- Saving the filtered embeddings for use in the categorization process

#### Additional Data Preparation

Depending on specific needs, additional notebooks may be used for tasks such as:

- Preparing example products for each category (to be used in prompts)
- Generating synthetic product data for testing
- Analyzing the distribution of products across categories

### Key Considerations

#### Category Descriptions

We emphasize the importance of clear, concise category descriptions. If using the GS1 GPC standard, these descriptions are provided. For custom category trees, it's worth investing time in writing good descriptions as they significantly improve the AI model's understanding and categorization accuracy.

#### Navigation Tree vs. Taxonomy

If starting with a navigation tree (which is common among retailers), we recommend transforming it into a taxonomy by removing duplicate categories. This process, which can be partially automated but may require some manual curation, ensures that each product has exactly one correct category, which is crucial for accurate automatic categorization.

#### Metaclass Quality

The quality of generated metaclasses has a significant impact on the system's performance. During the metaclass generation process, we apply various cleaning and filtering steps to ensure that the metaclasses are meaningful and distinctive. This may involve removing very common words, handling synonyms, and dealing with multi-word category names.

#### Word Embeddings

We use pre-trained word embeddings (e.g., from FastText) to capture semantic relationships between words. The choice of word embeddings can affect the system's performance, especially for specialized product domains. In some cases, it might be beneficial to fine-tune embeddings on domain-specific text data.

### Customization and Flexibility

The notebook-based approach allows for easy customization to handle different category tree structures or specific business requirements. Users can modify the cleaning and processing steps, adjust the metaclass generation algorithm, or incorporate additional data sources as needed.

### Conclusion

The category tree preparation process, implemented through a series of Jupyter notebooks, transforms raw category data into a structured, optimized format that powers our bottom-up categorization system. By carefully cleaning and organizing the category tree, generating high-quality metaclasses, and preparing appropriate word embeddings, we lay the foundation for accurate and efficient product categorization. This process is designed to be flexible and customizable, allowing it to adapt to various category structures and business needs.

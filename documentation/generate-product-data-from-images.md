# Generate Product Data from Images

## Overview

In the world of e-commerce, creating compelling product listings is crucial but often time-consuming. This solution automatically generates high-quality product titles and descriptions using product images and optional metadata. By leveraging AI, we aim to streamline the product onboarding process, reduce manual effort, and improve catalog consistency. This approach allows sellers to focus on other critical aspects of their business while ensuring their product listings are engaging and informative.

## What it Does

This solution takes one or more product images as input, along with optional metadata, and produces a concise, engaging product title (up to 60 characters) and an informative product description highlighting key features, benefits, and use cases. The generated content is tailored to the specific product shown in the images, taking into account any provided metadata or styling examples. The output can be customized in terms of language, description length, and tone to suit various e-commerce platforms and product categories.

## How it Works

The process begins with input processing, where the solution receives product images (stored in Amazon S3) and optional metadata. Configuration parameters such as language, description length, and styling examples are also accepted at this stage. Next, a carefully crafted prompt is constructed, incorporating the product images, metadata, and any provided examples. This prompt includes specific instructions for the AI model on how to generate the title and description.

Once the prompt is prepared, it is sent to Amazon Bedrock, which utilizes the Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku model. The model processes the input and generates the product title and description. After the AI model completes its task, the response, formatted in XML, is parsed to extract the generated title and description. Finally, the solution returns the generated product data, ready for further processing or storage in the product catalog.

## Why We Designed it This Way

Our choice of the Claude 3 Haiku model was driven by its optimal balance of performance, cost, and quality. While more powerful models like Claude 3 Sonnet are available, our testing showed that Haiku provides sufficiently good results for this task at a lower cost and with faster processing times. This decision aligns with our goal of creating an efficient and cost-effective solution for businesses of all sizes.

We leveraged Amazon Bedrock and AWS Lambda for their complementary strengths. Amazon Bedrock provides easy access to state-of-the-art AI models without the need for model training or management. AWS Lambda allows for serverless execution, optimizing costs and providing automatic scaling based on demand. This combination ensures that our solution is both powerful and scalable.

The decision to use XML for the model's output format was deliberate. XML provides more precise control over the response structure compared to JSON. By using XML tags as start and stop sequences, we can help prevent the model from generating extraneous content outside the desired structure, ensuring cleaner and more predictable outputs.

Flexibility was a key consideration in our design. The solution supports various customization options, including language selection, description length, and styling examples. This adaptability allows sellers to maintain consistent branding and tone across their product catalog while catering to different product types and e-commerce platforms.

While this solution focuses on single-product processing, we designed it to integrate seamlessly with AWS Step Functions for batch processing in the broader Smart Product Onboarding workflow. This integration allows for efficient handling of multiple products when needed.

Custom exceptions were implemented to manage retries in the Step Functions state machine or in the front-end application that calls the API for single product use cases. This approach helps handle potential issues and improves the overall reliability of the process.

By leveraging AI to automate the generation of product titles and descriptions, it demonstrates significant potential in reducing the time and effort required in the product onboarding process. The use of serverless architecture and a cost-effective AI model ensures that the solution is both scalable and economically viable for retailers of various sizes, making it a valuable tool in streamlining e-commerce operations.

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement a template system for the TypeScript product generator service to replace the current inline template string approach with a more maintainable template-based system, similar to the Jinja2 templates used in the Python packages. This will improve code readability, maintainability, and consistency across the codebase.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use external template files for prompt generation, so that I can maintain and modify prompts without changing TypeScript code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer needs to modify the product generation prompt THEN they SHALL be able to edit a template file without touching TypeScript code
2. WHEN the system generates prompts THEN it SHALL use template files instead of inline template strings
3. WHEN template files are updated THEN the changes SHALL be reflected in the generated prompts without code recompilation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want template files to be organized in a dedicated directory structure, so that templates are easy to find and manage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN templates are created THEN they SHALL be stored in a `templates/` directory within the TypeScript handlers directory
2. WHEN looking for templates THEN developers SHALL find them in a predictable location following the same pattern as Python packages
3. WHEN new templates are added THEN they SHALL follow the established directory structure

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use a JavaScript template engine that supports variable interpolation and conditional logic, so that I can create dynamic prompts similar to Jinja2 functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the template engine processes templates THEN it SHALL support variable interpolation for dynamic content
2. WHEN templates need conditional logic THEN the engine SHALL support if/else statements and loops
3. WHEN templates are processed THEN the output SHALL match the current prompt generation functionality
4. WHEN choosing a template engine THEN it SHALL be lightweight and have minimal dependencies

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the template system to maintain backward compatibility, so that existing functionality continues to work without breaking changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the template system is implemented THEN all existing API endpoints SHALL continue to function identically
2. WHEN prompts are generated THEN the output SHALL be functionally equivalent to the current implementation
3. WHEN the system processes requests THEN response formats and timing SHALL remain unchanged

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling for template operations, so that template issues are clearly diagnosed and don't crash the service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a template file is missing THEN the system SHALL throw a clear error message indicating the missing template
2. WHEN template syntax is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide helpful error messages for debugging
3. WHEN template rendering fails THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully without crashing the Lambda function

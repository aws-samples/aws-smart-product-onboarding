# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the existing website package from Create React App (CRA) to Vite. The migration is necessary because CRA has been officially deprecated as of February 2025, and Vite offers superior performance, faster builds, and better developer experience. The migration should maintain all existing functionality while improving build times and development workflow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate from CRA to Vite so that I can benefit from faster build times and modern tooling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the website SHALL build using Vite instead of react-scripts
2. WHEN running the development server THEN the system SHALL provide instant hot module replacement
3. WHEN building for production THEN the system SHALL generate optimized bundles with tree-shaking
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all existing functionality SHALL remain intact

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove CRA dependencies so that I can eliminate deprecated packages and reduce security vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CRA dependencies are removed THEN react-scripts SHALL be uninstalled from package.json
2. WHEN CRA dependencies are removed THEN all CRA-specific configurations SHALL be replaced with Vite equivalents
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL no longer depend on any deprecated CRA packages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain TypeScript support so that I can continue using type safety in the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN TypeScript compilation SHALL work with Vite
2. WHEN TypeScript files are modified THEN the system SHALL provide type checking and hot reload
3. WHEN building for production THEN TypeScript SHALL be properly transpiled

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to preserve existing build scripts and workflows so that CI/CD processes continue to work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN npm/pnpm scripts SHALL continue to work with updated commands
2. WHEN running tests THEN the test suite SHALL execute successfully
3. WHEN deploying THEN the build output SHALL be compatible with existing deployment processes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain compatibility with existing imports and assets so that no code changes are required.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all existing import statements SHALL continue to work
2. WHEN the migration is complete THEN static assets SHALL be properly handled
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN CSS imports and modules SHALL function correctly
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN environment variables SHALL be accessible

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate with the existing monorepo structure so that the website package works seamlessly with other packages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the website package SHALL integrate with Nx build system
2. WHEN the migration is complete THEN dependencies on other monorepo packages SHALL continue to work
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the Projen configuration SHALL be updated to reflect Vite usage

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove excessive pnpm package overrides so that package management is simplified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CRA is removed THEN pnpm package overrides related to CRA SHALL be eliminated
2. WHEN the migration is complete THEN package.json SHALL have minimal necessary overrides
3. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN version conflicts SHALL be resolved through proper dependency management
